# Marist Haskellers 2017
## Hacking in Haskell

This repository will serve as both a place to submit your lab and homework assignments and a way for me to share examples and snippets with you.

Note that I have created a branch for each student using the typical Marist *Firstname.Lastname* pattern. After cloning this repository, be sure to checkout your branch before working on any lab exercise or homework assignment.
